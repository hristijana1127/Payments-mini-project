# Payments-mini-project
A simple Payments web app built to track data for payments. Currently a work in progress. Feedback is welcome!

## Overview 
-Tracks the data for payments made by customers located in one region. It is currently a **work in progress** and I am working on improving its structure, features, and security.

## Features
Here are some of the main features of the project so far:
-**Spring Boot 3**: Designed with a layered architecture including controllers, services, and repositories.
-**Database**: Utilizes PostgreSQL 17 for relational database management.
-**DTO Mapping**: Implemented with MapStruct for efficient mapping of data transfer objects (DTOs).
-**Persistence**: Built using JPA, Hibernate, and Spring Data JPA for repository management.
-**Docker Integration**: Docker Compose is used for setting up and managing the database.


## Current Limitations
There are areas of the project that need further work:
- **Security**: The applicationâ€™s security implementation is a work in progress and will be refined further.
- **Efficiency**: Certain parts of the code structure need optimization for better performance and readability.
- **Other Features**: Some features are partially implemented but require refinement.
- **Testing**: Some unit and integration tests are still under development to improve code coverage.

## Future Plans
- Improve code structure for better efficiency and elegance.
- Fix security issues in the authentication system.
- Expand test coverage beyond 50% and refine test cases.
